# Linear Regression Model Task

This repository contains the code and documentation for the linear regression model task completed during my internship at Sparks Foundation.

## Overview

The task involved building a linear regression model to predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they study. The goal was to analyze the relationship between study hours and exam scores and create a model that could accurately predict scores for new data.

## Files Included

- **Task-1_Linear_Regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the following libraries and tools are required:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset contains two columns: "Hours" (number of study hours) and "Scores" (exam scores). This dataset was used to train and test the linear regression model.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting exam scores based on study hours.

## Prediction

The trained linear regression model successfully predicted a score of 93.69 marks for a student who studies for 9.25 hours. This prediction task demonstrates the practical application of the model for real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

The linear regression model demonstrated a strong correlation between study hours and exam scores, achieving a high accuracy rate in predicting scores for new data points. In particular, the model successfully predicted a score of 93.69 marks for a student who studies for 9.25 hours. This prediction showcases the practical application of the model and its ability to provide accurate estimates of exam scores based on study hours. Further improvements and optimizations can be explored to enhance the model's performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.
